Aesthetically, the presence of Burgess Creek along the entire frontage of the property offers the ability to bring the creek into the final development plans as a natural amenity. This parcel originally had a three story office/residential building that went into disrepair and was finally demolished. That foundation pad still remains and in an earlier Tri-plex plan was shown as a site for a multi-family development or a rehab of the building that was demolished. After a sale of the property for $12MM during the early 2000\u2019s bubble, the owners developed a conceptual plan approved by the city for a  complex containing 74 condominium units plus common area elements including below grade parking. This plan was never advanced beyond the conceptual stage and a later plan for 7 single family lots was developed as an alternative solution to the disposition of the property.",

An old farmer's road still exists through the property. This could serve as your driveway in to either park an RV or start your dream home build. From the photos, what appears to be at the end of that road is Ute Mountain. Ute is an ancient volcano where instead of pyroclastic debris spewing into the atmosphere, the lava flowed like honey and created this round mountain. Ute mountain resides in New Mexico.

The Sangres delight with their incredible phenomenon of often turning pink as the sun sets in the west. State line peak is also visible from here. The property is level and possesses enough trees to feel a little more private but not so many that you'd have to cut down a bunch just to haul in a camper. This land is in its raw state with sagebrush and wildflowers. There isn't an HOA or no build time requirements and only the county building codes apply. The new owner may choose to keep it vacant, use it as a camp site or even to build the home of their dreams. It is the perfect base camp for exploring southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "If you're looking for a simple, turn-key business opportunity that will immediately be profitable for you or your client, look no further! For nearly a decade, Go Blue Reprographics Inc--the only independent, large-format printing company for 250 miles--has been the go-to blueprint specialists. During the past decade, the owner has developed an exclusive, loyal, and longstanding list of reliable customers, most of whom are in the construction and architectural businesses. In its 10 years of operation, Go Blue has grossed over $1.4 MILLION. The seller is committed to seeing the next operator succeed, and will ensure that the new operator knows how to make the machines sing. The seller will provide training to the new operator, and will share different streams of income, the majority of which come from printing services (architectural and construction blueprints, survey plats, over-sized prints, large-volume documents, and quality scans). Although Go Blue is an independent printing operator, the company has great relationships with other printing businesses in town, ensuring a happy client every time. The sale of this business includes the printing/scanning equipment, all inventory, the customer lists, and a smooth handoff and training, ensuring success for an enterprising buyer. The FF&E, which is included in the sales price, has a value of approximately $180,000. Additionally, the business reliably grosses $150,000-200,000 per year. In the first 8 months of 2022, the P&L shows gross receipts of over $156,000!",

This Homestead was used for farming wheat, barley and oats which then transitioned to the Routt County Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in 1986 where under the guardianship of the Conservation the managed grassland and improvements of environmental quality have greatly benefitted the land. The CRP program ended in Oct 2021 leaving the new owner to manage as they choose. It is now 333 acres of prime grassland attracting various species of birds, including whooping cranes, game birds and sharing the serenity with the antelope, deer and elk. Located apx 10 miles SW of Hayden with access off of the graveled road of CR59A. The Homestead comes with 3 water sources rarely available on a property of this size. The first one is a permitted domestic well near the old home, the second being the Marvin D Barnes Springs which is registered and flows year round with the third being a registered monitoring well for a source of H2O on the south side of  property. Another rare bonus is the power line and power supply to the original Homestead, this saving thousands for any future construction. It keeps getting better...the Sellers are including all of their mineral rights which include some on adjacent property! Past oil and gas leases have proven to be lucrative according to the owner! Along with all of the pluses of the property, these 333 acres are surrounded by open farmland with vast panoramic views to the north of Bears Ears, the Hayden Valley and to the northeast stretching to Steamboat Springs area. CR 59A runs along the entire west side of the property providing direct access to numerous special sites. A recent survey was performed, corners are set and flagged. Older buildings, granaries and silos tell of a life past with a future of new agri type operations, hunting, rural living or a continued peaceful refuge for those seeking these qualities being offered in this new property available for the first time in a \"long\" time!",

This private and peaceful canyon with year-round flowing Jackson Creek running through it has a terrain comprised of a heavily forested north facing shaded hillside and across the creek sunny south facing slopes. During late winter, spring and very early summer the creek has a very high and energetic flow; the remainder of the year it\u2019s quiet and babbling. Beautiful waterfalls accent the east end of the creek just prior to flowing out onto the plains, passing through the adjacent Jackson Creek Ranch. The creek attracts a wide variety of wildlife, the sunrises are breathtaking and the colorful reflection of sunsets after the sun sinks behind the foothills to the west are a beautiful accent to day\u2019s end. This land is perfect for hiking, camping and lazing away the days in your private sanctuary. You are just a hike away to Pike National Forest and access to it\u2019s 100\u2019s of miles of trails. Should you choose to make this your primary or weekend/vacation home there are some very distinctive and unique building sites, with dramatic views, to explore.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "The Stagecoach Ranch at Aspen Meadows in north-central Fremont County is an ideally sized 160 acre ranch in a beautiful and still wild part of Colorado. It's a very private parcel as a result of being a part of a small, gated neighborhood with light covenants and as a result of of the fact that it is bordered on three sides by approximately 12,000+ acres of Colorado State and BLM/Federal lands. The ranch is nestled in a private valley featuring direct views of 31 Mile Mountain and Pikes Peak. The terrain is covered by ponderosa pine, douglas fir and aspen tree stands, granite rock outcroppings and gentle sloping meadows of native grass and seasonal wildflowers. This ranch lends itself perfectly to your off-grid adventures while you design and build your dream home. World class gold medal fly fishing on the famed South Platte and Arkansas Rivers is waiting 30 minutes away to the north and south of Stagecoach Ranch, respectively. A picturesque drainage runs along the east side of the property. At 160 acres of agriculturally zoned land, the ranch is eligible for Colorado's Landowner Preference Program (\"LPP\") where big game applications for Elk, Mule Deer and Pronghorn Antelope are exclusively issued to landowners. The parcel is approximately 2.5 hours southwest of Denver. Its approx. 1.5 hours west of Colorado Springs, and 40 minutes northwest of Canon City. Breckenridge ski resort is an hour north, and major retail and restaurants are within an hours drive.",

Isolated, yet close to the Sanchez Reservoir for fishing or boating. Closest city is Taos, New Mexico, for shopping, dining, or local entertainment. And oh yes, there are the wild horses.",

Situated on the corner of a cul-de-sac, with a few cleared choice areas to build a secluded forested haven. Once over the tree line, the un-ending views of the San Luis Valley and the Sangre De Cristo Mountains await. Tap fee paid on all three lots, which may be consolidated to reduce the annual POA and water bills. Crestone is a unique location, in part because there are no building codes in the county, so you can build your home with building materials (such as straw and hempcrete) that aren't allowed in many other places. For more information about the building restrictions in the Baca Grande neighborhood, please visit www.bacagrande.org. Crestone is home to dozens of religious organizations from around the world along with exceptional hiking, rock climbing, and three hot springs within an hour's drive. Come find your bliss in Crestone.",

Close to Golden Gate Canyon State Park and Jefferson County Open Spaces! 25 minutes to downtown Golden and 45 minutes to the downtowns of Boulder & Denver! This ranch currently has low agricultural taxes. Nearby world-class activities include skiing, biking, hiking, climbing, horseback riding, off-road driving trails, motorcycle riding, ghost towns, gold mines, bird watching, snowshoeing, white-water rafting, fly-fishing, target shooting, and hunting to name a few. For privacy and limited future development, the immediate area includes National Forest, Jefferson County Open Space, State Parks, and Colorado Division of Wildlife property. This will maintain the exceptional privacy, and limit development in the area. This rare mountain ranch with incredible views won't last long! FYI, the map on Zillow is not correct.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Rare opportunity to purchase a large R-2 lot in a developed location in Lakewood. This building site has good views to the south and west which has superior appeal in the single-family market. Vassar Avenue is not a through street so the neighborhood is tight knit hold community events annually. This lot sits opposite Lakewoods' newest open space park called \"Peakview\" directly to the north. Lakewood has many large open space areas and parks along the Bear Creek Watershed south of Yale and west to Morrison.  The neighborhood has good access to major commuter ways with employment opportunities close and throughout the metro area. Significant retail areas are located north along Alameda, Wadsworth and south of HWY 285. Schools are good and based on the city of residence with Jeffco and Denver Schools serving students in the area. \r\n\r\nThe largest portion of the lot is relatively flat then it gently slopes in the rear and west side of the lot, perfect for a walk-out lower level. There are several large trees on the west side of the lot and a couple in the middle which filter some of the possible views from the site. \r\n\r\nZoning is under the \"old\" zoning in Chapter 59. Denver did a rezoning of much of the city in 2010, but the zoning on the subject lot did not change. Allowed uses include single-family and multiple unit dwellings, child care centers, religious institutions, fire station, library, parks and police stations by right. Confirmed with City Planner that an ADU is possible.  The minimum site size in R-2 is 6,000 square feet with a 50-foot front foot. For each additional dwelling unit, the minimum size required is 3,000 square feet. There is a requirement to have open space of 62.5% of the lot including a rear portion of the lot of 60% and a front setback of 20 feet.",

Currently, on the lot, there is a small one-room log cabin. It could do with some updates to make it comfortable; however, it is usable. The property feels peaceful, private, and lush. This area is known for its various montane habitats, including Aspen groves, high riparian areas, mixed conifer forests, and rolling meadows. You can find Dusky Grouse and Elk roaming throughout the day, and at night you may be lucky enough to spot Flammulated Owls and Saw-Whet Owls. The town of Westcliffe is 30 min, Pueblo is roughly an hour's drive away, and Colorado Springs is approximately 1.5 hours away.",

An off-grid paradise where you can spread out! \r\nSouth Park is one of only 3 state-designated Heritage Areas. Known for its beautiful valley, the area briefly boomed in a gold rush in the 19th century. Residents and visitors are now attracted to mineral springs, hunting, fishing, wildflower meadows, and lungs full of fresh mountain air. Once you've had your fill of relaxation, a variety of nearby activities await. Climb some nearby 14ers or hike the Colorado Trail. Take your mountain bike to the Keystone Bike Park, various bike trails, or nearby Breckenridge. Go horseback riding or raft the #1 section of white water in Colorado, Browns Canyon. \r\nLike to fish? There are several lakes and reservoirs nearby that offer fishing year-round. Antero Reservoir, Eleven Mile State Park, Spinney Mountain, Jefferson Lake, Lake George, and the Dream Stream are all popular spots. \r\nA wildlife paradise. The south park valley has over 3 million acres of national forest and state public lands. Elk, deer, antelope, and bear are all common big animals in this area.\r\nEnjoy a faster adventure? Rent some ATVs and ride them around your new property. Or take your 4x4 off-roading at some of the nearby trails at Wheeler Lake, Georgia Pass, Slaughterhouse Gulch, and Red Cone. In the winter, enjoy a plethora of snowmobile trails.\r\nLast but certainly not least, enjoy some of the world's best skiing and snowboarding nearby! Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper Mountain, and A Basin await!\r\nIf you go to see the property, drive safe and check road conditions before you go. The area where this property is located is not plowed in the winter, so choose an appropriate vehicle and safety gear for the conditions.\r\nNote: The adjacent 4.8 acre parcel next to this one is also available. Combine them for nearly 10 acres!",

Lots are connected by a rolling slope offering multiple elevations with a few cleared choice areas to build a secluded forested haven. Once over the tree line, the un-ending views of the San Luis Valley and the Sangre De Cristo Mountains await. Crestone is a unique location, in part because there are no building codes in the county, so you can build your home with building materials (such as straw and hempcrete) that aren't allowed in many other places. For more information about the building restrictions in the Baca Grande neighborhood, please visit www.bacagrande.org. Crestone is home to dozens of religious organizations from around the world along with exceptional hiking, rock climbing, and three hot springs within an hour's drive. Come find your bliss in Crestone.",
